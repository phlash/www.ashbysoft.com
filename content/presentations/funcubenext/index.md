## FUNcube Next
### to boldly go...
Creating an open platform in space

(with apologies to Mr Dickens)

{{% note %}}
 * Not very technical (yet!)
 * Will cover four areas:
   * (past/present/future/actions)
   * A wee bit of history/learnings
   * Mission brief (to boldly go...)
   * What that might look like
   * Involvement/engagement points

## FUNcube Past
(learning from the ghosts of previous missions)
 * Timing is everything!
 * Testing is also everything!
 * Team size matters - close working, and
 * Documentation matters - a good ICD/API!
 * Ambition pays off :)
 * Engagement is limited :(

{{% note %}}
 * Launch dates moved, then moved...
 * Serious bug found after 2 years testing (FC-1)
 * Good progress at get-togethers (jelly babies)
 * Pain when working with partial docs and others (FC-2)
 * AO-40 telemetry on tiny MCU, lots of data, popular!
 * Only a few 'operators', exclusivity in dev.

## FUNcube Present
(creating our new mission)
 * {{< frag c="Do something new and ambitious..." >}}
 * {{< frag c="Keep the small team(s), but..." >}}
 * {{< frag c="Address engagement and docs challenge..." >}}
 * {{< frag c="Build a documented open space platform..." >}}
 * {{< frag c="A set of sensors, popular MCUs & APIs..." >}}
 * {{< frag c="So *everyone* can run code in space!" >}}

{{% note %}}
 * Don't throw away the good stuff
 * NB: teams plural, not just us :)
 * Work openly on docs and technologies to..
 * Everything in github from the start (PRs welcome)
 * Support parallel working / experiment creation!
 * Choose MCUs with low cost of entry, open dev kits..

## FUNcube Future
(what might that look like?)

TBD: diagram from Jason!

{{% note %}}
 * Here's where we are after 1 month thinking (mostly J!)
 * Two popular MCUs (STM32, K210), one with tensorflow ;)
 * Housekeeping system to guarantee behaviour for licence
 * Compatible with earlier missions (no wasted investment)
 * Optional 10GHz radio subsystem (phase synchronized).
 * Deployable as a payload in other missions (phew!)
 * Modular (more MCUs, different MCUs)

## FUNcube Next
(so what happens next?)

 * FUNcube Team:
   * Firm up choice of MCUs & interconnects
   * Produce ICD/APIs (sensors, telemetry, radios)
   * Gain launch approval of design
   * Develop platform to ICD/APIs
 * Experimenters:
   * Design experiments, play with dev kits
   * Engage with FUNcube team via Github (TBD!)
   * Have fun :)

{{% note %}}
 * Long way to go, we are 1 month in!
 * Will endeavour to work 100% in open
 * Will endeavour to be API-led, allowing early engagement
 * Housekeeping functions are critical to approval
 * Want to allow full baseband access to radios..
