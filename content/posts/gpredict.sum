[Phil](Phlash "wikilink") has been keeping himself busy over the
Christmas holiday period by helping with the Windows port of
[gpredict](http://gpredict.oz9aec.net/ "wikilink"), a popular satellite
tracking program. It\'s not done yet, but a workable binary is available
here:
<http://files.oz9aec.net/gpredict/temp/gpredict-win32-2.1.156.zip>. No
installer required, simply unzip and execute.
