[Tom](Thomas "wikilink") broke the USB connector off his phone, so I had
to disassemble it (no I really did!), and took the opportunity to take
some photos [ZTE-G X930 Insides](ZTE-G_X930_Insides "wikilink")

*08-Apr-11 Update*: I finally soldered a new connector back on - there
aren\'t many distributors of micro-USB surface mount sockets in the uk -
just Farnell it seems.
