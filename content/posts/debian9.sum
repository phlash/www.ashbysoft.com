After a few years of Ubuntu on home desktops/laptop,
[Phil](Phlash "wikilink") got weary of the growing instability, and
decided to look at Debian again. Turns out it\'s got pretty much
everything we need in the stable repository (stretch ATM), including a
working Gnome3 desktop setup (no more weird multi-screen issues as
below), so after upgrading his laptop, then the family desktops, we are
now a Debian 9 home :)
