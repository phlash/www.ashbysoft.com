In celebration of [FUNcube](FUNcube "wikilink")-1
(http://funcube.org.uk/) having been operational for 2 years,
[Helen](Helen "wikilink") made a cube cake, which we deployed :)

\"It\'s a cube cake!\"

That critical moment as the antenna are deployed..

Success - contact established :)

We just need to make a slight adjustment to the software\...

Happy 2nd Birthday [FUNcube](FUNcube "wikilink")-1!
