What's in the box Phil?
=======================

[I took some pictures](https://photos.app.goo.gl/EGLB6MBsZdFBRCjr5)

It appears to be the common Sunplus 1628A based reference design shared
by many similar Chinese origin trail cameras.

Did you reset the PIN?
======================

Err nope. No sign of a battery, so assuming it writes config to flash,
and I was unable to find a button-mashing-based reset process (although
there likely is one as the manufacturer offers a telephone reset service)

We got lucky, the owner suggested a few numeric pairs they usually use
(I know - poor practice, they know too), and after 20-30 combinations
we got the magic value :)
