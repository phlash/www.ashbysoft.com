[Joseph](Joseph "wikilink") brought his laptop home last weekend, with a
nasty problem: hard shut downs shortly after powering on. It seemed
thermal, mostly as the shut down would happen sooner with a warm system
and he\'d already tried the usual fault finding stuff, removing RAM
sticks, resetting CMOS etc, so we re-pasted and re-seated the heatsinks:
it got worse 8-/ In desperation we decided to \'reflow\' the motherboard
in the oven, 8mins @ 200C seemed to be the recommended procedure.. as
long as you have a good thermometer (not the oven thermostat). A bit of
rework extending the probe on a digital jam thermometer gave us an
internal temperature reading, and the cooking went ahead. Result? It
worked! Following re-assembly and a number of short reboot cycles while
the CMOS sorted itself out it\'s stayed working for a couple of days.
\[update 2016-03-14\]: it lasted just over a week, then the same bug
resurfaced :( [Joseph](Joseph "wikilink") is now on the backup laptop.
\[closure 2016-05-08\]: The supplier fitted a new motherboard after
their own investigation, so far so good..
