## Threat modelling is not voodoo

..honest it's not, but many folks think it's special and don't do it :( Thus [Phil]({{< relref "phlash.md" >}}) put a talk together for his local
OWASP chapter, which seemed to be well received (you can judge for yourself in the video of course!)

It's only taken 8 months to get the slides on line!
