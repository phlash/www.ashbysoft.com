[Phil](Phlash "wikilink") recently noticed that Google Picasa has been
discontinued since 2016 on all platforms, and he\'s heavily invested in
the facial recognition capability (over 200 people tagged in 20000+
photos over several years), with increasing likelihood that it will stop
working at any point. Time to [rescue the knowledge and find alternative
technology](Face_Recognition "wikilink")! Update: a working gThumb face
browser plugin now exists!
