While looking for a usable cheap FXO port to connect the PSTN to his
home server, [Phil](Phlash "wikilink") came across the OBIHAI product
line, and bought a couple of toys to play with: an
[OBIHAI110](http://www.obihai.com/docs/OBi110DS.pdf "wikilink") voice
service bridge, which will do pretty much what\'s required without the
server attached, and an
[ObiLINE](http://www.obihai.com/obiline "wikilink") USB FXO adapter,
which is [being reverse engineered](OBiLINE "wikilink") for fun :)
