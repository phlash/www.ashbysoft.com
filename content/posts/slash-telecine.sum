[Stu](Slash "wikilink") has been converting a Super8 film projector into
a telecine machine to convert his father-in-laws movies to digital
format. Inspired by [similar
projects](http://www.movie2video.com/index.php "wikilink") he has hacked
at a 1970s projector and some free animation software to produce some
watchable results. Still some way to go before they could be considered
a replacement for professional telecine services, but not bad for a few
quid in parts!
