So [Chrome will soon be flagging /any/ web
content](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/08/google_chrome_http_shame/ "wikilink")
served over plain HTTP as not secure. I suspect other browsers will
follow soon enough, so it\'s time to ensure everything served from here
is over TLS\... cue montage of rapid terminal activity\... aand it\'s
done. thanks Let\' Encrypt and NGiNX for handling SNI so easily! If you
have content hosted with us, and anything seems to have gone a bit
weird, please [let us know](mailto:support@ashbysoft.com "wikilink").
