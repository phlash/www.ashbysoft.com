[Erdos Bacon Sabbath
Numbers](http://erdosbaconsabbath.com/lists/ebs/ "wikilink") are a fun
(and slightly nerdy) measure of how close someone is to all three of
Paul Erdos, Kevin Bacon and Black Sabbath. Terry Pratchett is listed
with an EBS number of 9, but I think he\'s now one step closer to
Sabbath via a recent collaboration with Steeleye Span on the
\"Wintersmith\" album:
<http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2013/11/steeleye-span-wintersmith/> mentions
that the producer of Wintersmith is Chris Tsangarides
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Tsangarides>, who also worked with
Black Sabbath. TerryP-\>ChrisT-\>Sabbath? [Phil](Phlash "wikilink")
\[edited: 2014-12-15\] Well the EBS team don\'t do producers but I get a
credit for improving the musical linkage :)
