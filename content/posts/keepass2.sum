Earlier this year the [Have I Been
Pwned?](https://haveibeenpwned.com "wikilink") service released their
new API, with a cool \'k-anonymity\' partial hash checker function to
permit searches of potentially compromised password hashes without
providing a materially significant proportion of your password.
[Phil](Phlash "wikilink")\'s favourite password manager,
[KeePass2](https://keepass.info/ "wikilink"), supports this new API, but
doesn\'t work on Debian (or possibly other derivatives) as the
mono-runtime does not have [TLS1](TLS1 "wikilink").2 capable networking
- shame on you Debian, it\'s been available in Mono since 4.8.0 in Feb
\'17. So what\'s a hacker to do? Write their own plugin of course:
