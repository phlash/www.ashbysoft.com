Slightly Acidic
===============

What do you call a sharp-edged, slight funky/quirky electric folk/rock
band (anything, they can\'t hear you - ed.)? Ours was called pH5
(geddit?), and it existed from \~1994 - 1999. Band members:

-   Dr. Simon Phoenix: keyboard wizard, technohead, muso and lyricist.
-   [Stuart](Slash "wikilink") Ashby: guitars, percussion, engineering
    and vocals
-   [Phil](Phlash "wikilink") Ashby: bass, percussion, engineering.
-   Maurice Patrick, violin - just that, but bloody good at it :)

New(ish) Material (2009!)
=========================

Back in 2009 - [Phil](Phlash "wikilink") uncovered a couple of
un-mastered tracks recorded by pH5 back in late \'99 or thereabouts -
probably in [Stuart](Slash "wikilink")\'s house, just before the band
separated to pursue their own interests, so for your listening delight,
I mixed them for release here:
