I took Tom\'s phone apart
=========================

Since there do not appear to be any internal photos of the ZTE-G X930
mobile on the \'net at the moment (and it\'s not FCC registered) and
[Tom](Thomas "wikilink") broke off his USB socket, requiring the phone
to be dismantled, I took the opportunity to photograph the insides,
enjoy (click for larger version):

Not very surprising really - it\'s the same !MediaTek ARM-based
processor as many other Chinese mobiles (MT6235BA), and thus likely runs
the Nucleus Plus OS like the [Sciphone
i68+](http://home.comcast.net/~plutarch/Sciphone-i68.html "wikilink").
The soldered in battery is a bit unusual - probably internal RAM backup
(in which case we\'d better hope Tom had nothing irreplaceable in
there!)
