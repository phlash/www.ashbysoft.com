The Old Bald Man :)
-------------------

Phil is 5\' 7\", in his early 50\'s, with hazel eyes & dark brown hair
(what\'s left of it!). He wears glasses because he is myopic
(short-sighted) but refuses to wear contact lenses.

He\'s enjoying being \"grandad\" when he\'s home (not often enough :-),
and considers himself reasonably experienced in this field with six
children & two grandchildren (the last time he counted).

Phil works as a technical architect for [GB
Group](http://www.gbgplc.com "wikilink"), looking after the design of
their services.

Phil is also a founder of (AshbySoft \*), and when he\'s not playing
with the kids, he can usually be found playing with his computer, having
a technical discussion with [Stuart](Slash "wikilink") or trying to
organise a night out with his lovely wife [Angela](Angela "wikilink").

More recently (ok - in 2003) Phil joined the [4 Or
More](http://www.4ormore.co.uk "wikilink") large family website, and is
now hosting their forum on this server :)

You can also find Phil on

Stuff
-----

I do stuff outside the day job, in particular:

-   [Funcube](http://funcube.org.uk "wikilink"): I\'m a developer on
    this combined amateur radio / educational satellite development
    team - three launched, others in the pipeline..
-   I\'m a qualified radio amateur (callsigns M6IPX, 2E0IPX), interested
    in VLF communications (sub 100kHz), software defined radio and toys
    :)
-   I take stuff apart, then sometimes blog about it
    [here](News "wikilink"), frequently before I\'ve used it!
-   Amateur genealogy, researching my own family tree with a friend who
    is semi-professional. It\'s amazing what you discover - who would
    have though I was descended from a long line of east-end chimney
    sweeps? Aye- aye me ol\' china!
