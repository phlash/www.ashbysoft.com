The Legendary Faulkener-Davis Music Award
=========================================

Battle Of The Bands
-------------------

### Oh Yeah

Time:

19:00 - 22:00

Location:

St. Albans High School, Ipswich

Prices:

Adults £4 Concessions £2

We may have played The Regent, The Spa Pavillion and The Corn Exchange
but NOTHING compares to the Faulkner-Davis Music Award. As current
holders we will be defending our title (and giving Francis something to
do on his Birthday).
