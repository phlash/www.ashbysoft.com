1.  1.  guitar

[Bob](Robert "wikilink") decided to spend his 16th birthday money on a
new axe, but not just any axe - oh no - a clear acrylic Wesley Strat
copy (PE200wh). Of course a perfectly clear acrylic block just begs to
be lit up from the inside. Oh yes it does :)

1.  1.  pond

In an effort to move our pets outside, to encourage more wildlife in the
garden and to grow more interesting plants, Angela, Phil and the family
have built a pond. Bring on the herons!

1.  1.  shed

Constructed between Oct/Dec 2005 to replace the mouldy old shed in Phil
and Angela\'s back garden, \"the shed\" is intended as a recording
studio / drum practice room and general bolt hole :) Getting the panels
into the garden was entertaining\...

1.  1.  zen

Built between September 2004 and July 2005, Stuart decided to cure his
garden grass and weed problem in a permanent fashion.. and learn a bit
of Zen/Shinto culture in the process.

1.  1.  maps

[Bob](Robert "wikilink") has been busying himself with the latest [Valve
Software](http://www.valvesoftware.com/ "wikilink") Hammer editor,
producing several new maps for the Counter-Strike:Condition Zero game..

1.  1.  conservatory

Built between April and November 2003 (but not finished until 2005!),
this was Phil\'s first serious building project, and it was quite a
challenge!

1.  1.  end
