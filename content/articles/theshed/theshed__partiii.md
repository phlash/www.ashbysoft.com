summary: fittings, and fancy acoustics

Interior construction
=====================

{{< figure src="../fw_ceil.jpg" link="../fw_ceil.jpg" width="256" height="192" class="float-right" >}}

So the plan (which I will at some point scan in and put here!) goes like
this:

-   Install hidden wiring for lights and power.
-   Line the walls and ceiling with good quaility acoustic / thermal
    insulation and plasterboard.
-   Install lights and heating!!
-   Build a partition wall across the middle, at an angle, with a double
    door and window to create an isolation booth / drum room.
-   Insulate the booth floor with jabloc or similar underfloor
    polystyrene slabs.
-   Pave the booth floor to provide an acoustic mass, line with ply or
    MDF.
-   Install acoustic absorbers and diffractors in the booth to control
    resonances.

Simple huh? Well yes, but it's a slow and fiddly job and frequent stops
for tea to warm our hands up don't really help :)

Install Wiring
--------------

This was actually rather easy - once I had decided *where* the lights
needed to be, it was just a case of tacking in the cables, marking the
ends so I could tell which is which once the lining is in (thus hiding
the cables), and getting hold of some 3-core + earth for the switch
(which ended up coming from a wholesaler on a 50m roll, of which I used
2m :)

Line the walls / ceiling
------------------------

{{< figure src="../shoot.jpg" link="../shoot.jpg" width="256" height="192" class="float-right" >}}

After some research (ie: surfing the 'net for hours) I chose to use
[Crown Acoustic Partition Roll](https://www.knaufinsulation.co.uk/output/products/page_294.html)
in conjunction with ½" plasterboard which should achieve 20-30dB of
sound insulation and excellent thermal insulation too.

That dangerous looking chap on the right is [Martin]({{< relref "martin.md" >}})
practising holding up a bank with a staple gun... silly boy.

Installing said lining is taking a while, but we're half way there now
(11th Jan '06). The ceiling (see above) gave us the most
'entertainment' since a whole sheet of ½" plasterboard weighs about
40kg; Martin and I tried holding that over our heads for several
minutes while [Joseph]({{< relref "joseph.md" >}}) rushed up
and down the ladder putting the screws in! Not good. It's much easier
with four people holding the board up (thanks to
[Rob]({{< relref "robert.md" >}}) and [Angela](#) :)

Here's [Stuart]({{< relref "slash.md" >}}) putting up the final piece of lining
on the front wall, it was starting to get quite warm inside by this
point.
