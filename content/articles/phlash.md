The Old Bald Man :)
-------------------

{{< figure src="../../images/upload/phil-boat-2010.jpg" class="float-right" >}}

Phil is 5' 7", in his early 50's, with hazel eyes & dark brown hair
(what's left of it!). He wears glasses because he is myopic
(short-sighted) but refuses to wear contact lenses.

He's enjoying being "grandad" when he's home (not often enough :-),
and considers himself reasonably experienced in this field with six
children & three grandchildren (the last time he counted).

Phil works as a technical architect for [GB Group](http://www.gbgplc.com),
looking after the design of their services.

Phil is also a founder of (Ashbysoft *), and when he's not playing
with the kids, he can usually be found playing with his computer, having
a technical discussion with [Stuart]({{< relref "slash.md" >}}) or trying to
organise a night out with his lovely wife [Angela](#).

More recently (ok - in 2003) Phil joined the
[4 Or More](https://www.4ormore.co.uk) large family website, and was
hosting their forum on this server. 4 Or More have now mostly moved
away to Facebook, their original forum is now an archive hereabouts.

You can also find Phil on

Stuff
-----

I do stuff outside the day job, in particular:

-   [Funcube](https://funcube.org.uk): I'm a developer on this combined
    amateur radio / educational satellite development team - five launched,
    others in the pipeline..
-   I'm a qualified radio amateur (callsigns M6IPX, 2E0IPX), interested
    in VLF communications (sub 100kHz), software defined radio and toys
    :)
-   I take stuff apart, then sometimes blog about it [here](/posts/),
    frequently before I've used it!
-   Amateur genealogy, researching my own family tree with a friend who
    is semi-professional. It's amazing what you discover - who would
    have though I was descended from a long line of east-end chimney
    sweeps? Aye- aye me ol' china!
