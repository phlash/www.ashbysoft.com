Hi, I am Martin, member of the Ashby family, physics student at Warwick
University, and wannabe musician. I will reply to email I find
interesting, and I also have
[facebook](https://www.facebook.com).

Life:
=====

Consists of getting along with everyone if possible, particularly my
girlfriend Georgia. At some point in the near future I will realise that
guitar hero is not the path to passing my degree and do some work. In
the meantime I proceed with normal student/teenager like activities,
plus walking, cycling and minus some of the drinking.

Friends:
========

I do have some, somewhere :) they know who they are and most of them
have facebook or some means of communication available to them. Also I
probably owe some of them money...

Future:
=======

In no way do I attempt to predict the future, but after my degree I will
inevitably need to pay off student debt. I hope to do this by moving in
with Georgia plus friends and getting some kind of real work. I would
much prefer to do this by starting some kind of musical career, writing
and/or performing interesting and varied bits of popular music
entertainment. As a back up option I have always considered robbing a
bank or pulling off some major fraud, although now this is publicly
disclosed I would hasten to add that it is very unlikely.

Music:
======

I describe myself as wannabe musician purely because I am not a pro. I
have however been playing drums for nearly 8 years, guitar for 5 years
and other instruments as and when people have shown me how to play them.
I have featured in numerous musical escapades, most recently playing
bass guitar and drums in
[Quorn](http://www.myspace.com/thekamikazewatermelons). Since
joining Warwick Uni I have become an active member of the drumming
society, and have developed a taste for samba.

Education:
==========

I attended St Albans RC High school in Ipswich, including 6th form, and
came out with some A levels and GCSEs: A's in maths, more maths and
physics, and a C in French. I am now on a 3 year course in Physics at
[Warwick University](https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/) as previously
mentioned, which is pretty interesting most of the time, and not too
much work so far. This will change no doubt.

Entertainment:
==============

For entertainment I have many options, most preferable is adventuring
with Georgia. Recent times have seen us walk around 20 miles or
something like that, see some amazing sights and find tyre swings.
Jamming with Robert is another favourite activity, and others to follow
include guitar hero in Whitefields 6, drumming sociey sessions, cycling
and other sports, and just random things that happen really.

**NB**: If you are Carl Free, please get a life.
