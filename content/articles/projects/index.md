[Bob]({{< relref "robert.md" >}}) decided to spend his 16th birthday money on a
new axe, but not just any axe - oh no - a clear acrylic Wesley Strat
copy (PE200wh). Of course a perfectly clear acrylic block just begs to
be lit up from the inside. Oh yes it does :)

({{< relref "thepond" >}})

In an effort to move our pets outside, to encourage more wildlife in the
garden and to grow more interesting plants, Angela, Phil and the family
have built a pond. Bring on the herons!

### Shed

({{< relref "theshed" >}})

Constructed between Oct/Dec 2005 to replace the mouldy old shed in Phil
and Angela's back garden, "the shed" is intended as a recording
studio / drum practice room and general bolt hole :) Getting the panels
into the garden was entertaining...

[Bob]({{< relref "robert.md" >}}) has been busying himself with the latest
[Valve Software](http://www.valvesoftware.com/ "wikilink") Hammer editor,
producing several new maps for the Counter-Strike:Condition Zero game..

({{< relref "theconservatory" >}})

Built between April and November 2003 (but not finished until 2005..),
this was Phil's first serious building project, and it was quite a
challenge!
