The History
===========

You know how old shed\'s turn into music practice rooms don\'t you? Yes
you do\...

`. "Where should we put this drum kit?"`

`. "I need a decent (cf: loud) guitar amp." "Hey Dad! We're getting a band together!"`

\...and suddenly your shed is a music room, come tool store, come
dangerous chemical locker (and that\'s just the teenagers!)

Then the roof gives way one winter, so you patch it up ASAP, then a
whole panel rots through at the back, so you patch that up too\... now
the music gear is in danger of being flooded if it rains, it\'s too hot
in summer, too cold in winter and too noisy all the year round :) In
short, we need a plan\...

The Plan
========

The music is good, but the neighbours need protection, the band need to
get some proper recording work done (besides I\'ve always wanted my own
recording studio) and I might like a home office, so a plan is hatched,
discussed and cogitated upon:

-   Replace the existing shed with a new one, big enough to
    accomodate\...
-   An internal, acoustically insulated drum room, and
-   A monitoring / mixing / work area.
-   Fan-ventilate it for cooling, add an electric heater for winter.
-   Fit a mixing desk / recording workstation / office PC.
-   Provide storage for gig quality amplifiers.
-   Retain the mains power feed, and..
-   Fit a mains intercom back to the house - perhaps a [mains
    network](http://www.devolo.co.uk/ "wikilink") later when using as an
    office ;-)

The Supplier
============

So who would supply a custom sized heavy duty shed at a reasonable
price? After much Googling [Angela](Angela "wikilink") found [Taylors
Garden Buildings](http://www.taylorsgardenbuildings.co.uk/ "wikilink"),
who were able to make a shed to the required height (9 feet), and locate
the door and windows appropriately, but best of all deliver cheaply
since they were in our region (East Anglia) - we placed our order and
waited\...

The Garage Roof
===============

After a minor delay (apparantly there was a bit of a rush on sheds this
autumn!), the nice chaps with a van arrived - and asked me how I
intended to get the large, heavy panels into the back garden. Much to
their astonishment I explained that we intended to lift them over the
garage roof, since we have no side access and the land behind the plot
is council owned and bordered by a high privet hedge which I considered
more difficult to negotiate than a solid flat-roof garage!

With much assistance from [Martin](Martin "wikilink"),
[Robert](Robert "wikilink"), [Joseph](Joseph "wikilink"),
[Angela](Angela "wikilink") and [Stuart](Slash "wikilink"), and a couple
of ladders we were able to carry the panels over the garage roof, slowly
but surely. As requested by the chaps who delivered them, here are some
photos of this process :)

Thanks..
========

As ever - nothing is possible without some enthusiastic helpers:

-   [The family](Family "wikilink") - for lots of things
-   [Stuart](Slash "wikilink") - for lifting and firelighting :)
