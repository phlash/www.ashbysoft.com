We are a small family software firm with a wide range of experience in
embedded systems, personal computer applications, and distributed
systems fields.

People..
========

-   [Phil Ashby]({{< relref "phlash.md" >}}): Currently a technical architect
    with GB Group.
-   [Stuart Ashby]({{< relref "slash.md" >}}): The recently retired interactive TV
    systems architect with NDS, a major technology provider to several
    large TV companies.

Experience..
============

We consider ourselves to be expert in both high level OO design (systems
and software), and low level systems programming with published work in
both areas, including:

-   a real-time interactive TV platform (QVC Active)
-   a UK scale interactive speech system (!CallMinder)
-   a world-wide multi-player gaming system (Wireplay3)
-   a Windows device driver (Wireplay.VxD)
-   an Internet content filter (ICRAfilter)
-   a professional hosting service portal (BT Selfcare)

We enjoy working with the C/C++, Java & .NET ecosystems, where our depth
of experience allows us to work with many target environments (eg: Windows,
Linux, VxWorks, Solaris, OpenTV), in particular hetrogeneous
distributed platforms.

We also have some experience with assembly code on Intel x86, SPARC & ARM
CPUs, but prefer not to mention it in these 4th-gen language days ;-)
